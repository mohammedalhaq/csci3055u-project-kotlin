## About the language

> _Describe the Language_
- Kotlin is an open source programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Its a functional programming language, like Clojure,  which is relatively easy to learn.

- Google endorsed Kotlin and decided to support the language for Android Development at Google I/O 2017. Kotlin is now natively supported in Android Studio as of version 3.0
